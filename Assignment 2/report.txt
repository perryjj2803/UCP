I was initially going to submit without a working movement() function however after writing my initial report I was about to submit and noticed a syntax error in my snake_movement.c which i rectified
and it fixed my movement function entirely. As such I had very little time to test and fix my food counter/tally.

I implemented the food counter but its hard to test given I couldnâ€™t make the snake move right up until submission. food counter is incremented within condition 
when the snake coordinates in the play area match that of the foods coordinates, this both increments the foodTally and is meant to be reflected in the output with foodTally/foodToWin displayed.
While trying to debug I was going to change foodTally to a pointer but I got the warning that when I was incrementing foodTally it wasnt being used.

I also implemented the correct conditions for game over (hitting a border) and when to win (when foodTally == foodToWin). But I could not get foodTally to increment properly and test the win condition.

As for fully completed functionalities. Correct command line arguments, FileIO and snake movement have been fully completed.
My linkedlists however are not generic and winning the game is programmed but cannot be tested due to foodTally not incrementing as expected.

Also I receive a warning on compile for implicit declaration of the random functions which I did not program but used as per assignment instructions and I was unable to fix this. And I received an extension til 24/5 hence the day late submission.
